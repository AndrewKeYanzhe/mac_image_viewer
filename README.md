When I switched to macOS, I missed [Irfanview](https://www.irfanview.com) from Windows. I wanted a Mac app to quickly go through images in a folder by hitting left and right arrow keys, and also be able to copy the images to paste in another folder or in a document.

Thinking about it, it seemed like a pretty simple app to make and a great opportunity to dip my toes in Swift and Swift UI, so I did!

- Simple and fast
- Navigate images in a folder by hitting left/right arrow
- Remember image from last session (optional)
- Copy image (useful for pasting in another folder or into a document) or image path (useful for pasting the path in a Terminal)
- Trash and Delete files
- Multiple ways to open images:
	- Drag n drop onto window
	- Drag n drop onto icon
	- File > Open... menu
	- Right click image > Open With
- Filename, position in folder and resolution shown in title bar (customizable)

# Download

- Download from the [Releases](https://github.com/lambdan/imageviewer5/releases) page
- Minimum macOS version is 11.0
