When I switched to macOS, I missed [Irfanview](https://www.irfanview.com) from Windows. I wanted a Mac app to quickly go through images in a folder by hitting left and right arrow keys, and also be able to copy the images to paste in another folder or in a document.

Thinking about it, it seemed like a pretty simple app to make and a great opportunity to dip my toes in Swift and Swift UI, so I did!

## Features

- Navigate images in a folder by hitting left/right arrow
- Copy image or image path
- Trash and Delete files 
- Open a image through the File > Open menu, Right clicking an image and using Open With or Drag an image onto the Dock icon
- Filename, position in folder and resolution shown in title bar
- ...and that's it! Nice and simple, and fast.

The icon is a random mess I made quickly, it'll get replaced eventually... or maybe not:
