# imageviewer5
Simple and fast image viewer for macOS written with Swift and Swift UI

When I switched to macOS, I missed [Irfanview](https://www.irfanview.com) from Windows. I wanted a Mac app to quickly go through images in a folder by hitting left and right arrow keys, and also be able to copy the images to paste in another folder or in a document.

_imageviewer5_ does this.

## Features

- Navigate images in a folder by hitting left/right arrow
- Copy image by hitting ⌘C
- Copy path to image by hitting ⌥⌘C
- Open a image through the File > Open menu, Right clicking an image and using Open With or Drag an image onto the Dock icon
- ...and that's it! Nice and simple, and fast.
