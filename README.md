When I switched to macOS, I missed [Irfanview](https://www.irfanview.com) from Windows. I wanted a Mac app to quickly go through images in a folder by hitting left and right arrow keys, and also be able to copy the images to paste in another folder or in a document.

Thinking about it, it seemed like a pretty simple app to make and a great opportunity to dip my toes in Swift and Swift UI, so I did!
